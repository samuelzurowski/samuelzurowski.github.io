        <ul class="resume-item-list">


          <li>
            Currently working on research on a subset of Android applications where discovered
            were several security vulnerabilities that resulted in implications such deanonymization 
            and other privacy issues.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Employed on a grant funded by the NSA to reverse engineer the V8 JavaScript engine to 
            recover objects in memory forensics to aide in investigations.
          </li>

          <li>
            Primary responsibilities include:  reverse engineering V8 data structures, 
            testing recovery approach, data analysis (pandas, jupyter-notebook, etc),
